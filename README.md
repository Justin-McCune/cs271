This is a repository of my projects. 
This is the first repository I'm pushing to git for my cs271 course. (Winter 2019). 


Testing to see if my username change affected where my local repository is pointing!

Just messing with my readme file. 


I reverted my username back to pandaroll. I like it better and it is helping me to understand how github works.
